SignalK-SensESP-CYD-Display
===========================

# Intro
This is my attempt to use a Cheap Yellow Display and SesnsESP ^3.0 for a Signal K server remote touchscreen display. The CYD board is a low-cost ESP32 bassed color LCD display with a pixel resolution of 320x240 and a resitive touchscreen. Here I use the display to show various SK data points at appropriate intervals.
